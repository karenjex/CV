# Karen Hope Jex
## Senior Solutions Architect

Customer-focused database expert, recognised contributor to the [PostgreSQL project](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/), member of the Board of [PostgreSQL Europe](postgresql.eu/), and Founder & Chair of its Diversity Committee.
With over 20 years of experience — starting in the Oracle ecosystem and transitioning into open source — I bring deep technical expertise and a passion for solving complex database challenges.

I actively support the PostgreSQL open source community through my leadership on the PostgreSQL Europe Board and by championing inclusion and accessibility as Chair of the Diversity Committee. I help clients get the most out of PostgreSQL through hands-on consulting, knowledge sharing, documentation development, and process optimisation.

A frequently invited [speaker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0IpRBoeAG2MrhwrFbDcu7W2LK9QN8dbE) at major PostgreSQL and developer conferences, I also lead trainings and mentor aspiring database professionals, helping others thrive in the open source space.
